<h1>Using JMRI and XTrackCAD Together</h1>

<img src="../../../images/xtracadreader.png" width="147" height="53" alt="XtrkCad and JMRI" align="right">
XtrkCadReader is a java tool that can take a layout file created with the
<a href="http://www.xtrkcad.org/">XTrackCAD layout design program</a>
and convert it to a panel file JMRI can use.

<p>
It can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/XTrkCadReader/releases">Releases page</a> on GitHub.
<br>
A <a href="XtrkCadReader.pdf">Manual (PDF)</a> describing how to run XtrkCadReader, including the
options and limitations, is include in the download together with several example files.
<span class="since">Since XtrkCadReader 2.2.2</span>

<p>
When you design a layout with XTrackCAD, the information about track, turnouts,
and their connections is stored in an "XTC" file.
When you run XtrkCadReader with an XTC file as input, it creates
an "XML" file for JMRI that contains the corresponding information.<br>
You can then read that XML file into JMRI PanelPro to create a
<a href="../../../help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor</a> panel
that represents your trackwork.

<p>
XtrkCadReader was created by Giorgio Terdina from 2008. It was updated since.<br>
Release 2.2.2 works with both JMRI 4.12
and XTrackCAD 5.1.1.<br>
XtrkCadReader is part of the JMRI project and is available under the
GNU General Public License. For additional information about
