    This page describes JMRI releases.  Briefly, we have three kinds:
    <ul>
    <li>"<a href="#prod-rel">Production releases</a>" about twice a year.  These are the ones we recommend to general users.
    <li>"<a href="#test-rel">Test releases</a>", usually <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open">about monthly</a>.
        These contain new features and changes that will eventually appear in the next production release.
    <li>Development builds, which are created every few hours as the 
        developers update the code. You can 
        <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">download one of these</a>
        if you want quick access to some particular fix, but please note that they're
        not fully tested. Test releases get more testing as part of the release process.
    </ul>
    For more information on the (intended) release schedule, see the 
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open">current list of milestones</a>
    and the 
    <a href="../help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">development roadmap</a>.
    
    <p>If you've never installed a version of this program before, 
    please read the installation guide (on the left) for your computer type and layout hardware. 
    They will show you how to install the things that are needed before the program will run. 
    These additional preliminary steps are one-time only and not necessary when updating. 
    If you've previously installed a working version of the program, you
	only need to download and install one of the files
	listed below to update.</p>

	<a href="../install/MacOSX.shtml">Mac OS X</a>,
	<a href="../install/Linux.shtml">Linux</a>

    <h2>JMRI - Test Releases</h2>
    <p>As the program develops, we also produce test releases. You may
	    want to try these, as new features will show up in them first. They

	    <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRI users</a> Groups.io group.</p>
    <p>
        The most current test release is JMRI 4.17.5.  More information on it,
        including the links to download a copy, can be found in
        <a href="../releasenotes/jmri4.17.5.shtml">release note</a>.
