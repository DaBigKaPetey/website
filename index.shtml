		<p> The JMRI project is building tools for model railroad computer control. 
		    We want it to be usable to as many people as possible, 
		    so we're building it in Java to run anywhere, 
		    and we're trying to make it independent of specific hardware systems.</p>
		<p> JMRI is intended as a jumping-off point for hobbyists 
		    who want to control their layouts with a computer
		    without having to create an entire system from scratch.</p>
		<p> You can manage your locomotive rosters and easily program your decoders using
		    <a href="./help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/index.shtml">DecoderPro&reg;</a>.
		    You can build control panels and control
		    your layout using
		<a href="./help/en/html/apps/PanelPro/index.shtml">PanelPro&trade;</a> to set up signaling.
		<a href="./help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/operations/Operations.shtml">OperationsPro&trade;</a>
		    lets you create manifests that route cars across your railroad from shipper to receiver,
		    and provide train crews with operating instructions.</p>
		<p> Going beyond the basics, you can use <a href="./help/en/html/tools/Logix.shtml">Logix</a> to
		    automate your layout's behavior, interface with X10 and Insteon systems to control your 
		    layout room's <a href="./help/en/html/tools/Lights.shtml">lights</a> 		    
		    and write 
		    <a href="./help/en/html/tools/scripting/index.shtml">scripts</a> to extend the capabilities 
		    of the system.</p>

				<a href="community/connections/XtrkCadReader/index.shtml">XtrkCadReader</a>
				is a JMRI tool built by Giorgio Terdina to take layout information created
				by XTrackCAD (XTC files) and convert it to a form that JMRI can read (XML files).
				<p>This tool lets you import your physical layout design from XTrkCad directly
				into JMRI so you can easily set up controls for the layout you've built.

		    	JMRI is an informal open-source software group. 
		    	We do this for the joy of model railroading, and don't produce anything for profit. 
		    	<p>
		    	One of our members has spent the past four years in the Federal Courts
		    	<a href="/k/summary.shtml">defending our right to continue</a> 
		    	against an individual who has attacked us with
		    	bogus patent threats, cybersquatting, copyright infringement and other illegal acts.

		    	<p>
		    	We are extremely pleased to announce that this case has now been 
		    	<a href="/k/Recent.shtml#2010-02-17">settled</a>. 
		    	The agreement ends the dispute, and gives everybody involved a way to move forward.
		    	This is a victory for JMRI and open-source software in general.
